* Categorical Logic and Type Theory in Cubical

This library is an extension of the cubical library [1] focused on
formalization of categorical logic and applications to type theory,
especially logical relations. Most of the library is intended to
eventually be merged upstream after we have experience with the design
here.

* Style and Build Tests

There are style constraints on whitespace that are used upstream, so we check those with the ~fix-whitespace~ whitespace utility. This checks things like trailing whitespace, tabs v. spaces, etc. There are `makefile` targets to check and fix any whitespace issues.

To check if all of the repository compiles, run ~make test~. Note that ~make test~ is what is ran on each push, so it also does the above whitespace checks.
